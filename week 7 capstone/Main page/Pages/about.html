            <h2>About us</h2>
            
            <h3 id="about">Our company was formed in the late 70's by Andrew Ryan , A man who was raised in the downtown area of Los Angles.
                 As a young child he would often try to pitch his ideas to the rascals he would play with, but no one was interested.
                When Andrew was an adult he took out a loan and started a business, that business was a failure. After that he tried starting many businesses which also failed.
                After many failed businesses later he had his greatest business idea ever, what if he sold the ideas of others.
                So with this idea he borrowed some money from a friend and let the idea flow and thus Think CO. was founded.
